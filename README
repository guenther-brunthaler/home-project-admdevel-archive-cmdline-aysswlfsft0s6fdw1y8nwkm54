Linux one-liners for priviliged and normal users which might be useful again.

Every file normally contains two lines:

* The first is a real comment and shortly describes what the one-liner does.

* The second line is the actual one-liner, commented out for security.

The one-liners in this repository are intended to be useful for both administative users and un-privileged users.

One-liners only useful for privileged users should not be put here.

This repository only contains one-liners for the POSIX shell. Bash-extensions (or those of other shells) shall *not* be used.

Therefore, the scripts should for example run without any change in bash, dash and BusyBox ash, ksh and zsh.

However, they might be Linux-specific and use non-standardized features like "date +%s" or "stat -c", altough such Linux-specifics should be avoided if a POSIX utility can do the same job.

In order to use such one-liners, in Bash you can use

$ history -r /path/to/oneliner.sh

in order to append the one-liner the shell command history. Then go can go back to the (new) last history entry, customize the command if necessary, un-comment it, and execute it.
