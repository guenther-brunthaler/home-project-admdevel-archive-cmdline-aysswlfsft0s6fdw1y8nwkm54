One-liners which might be useful again.

Every file normally contains two lines:

* The first is a real comment and shortly describes what the one-liner does.

* The second line is the actual one-liner, commented out for security.

The one-liners in this repository are intended to be useful for both administative users and un-privileged users.

One-liners only useful for privileged users should not be put here.
